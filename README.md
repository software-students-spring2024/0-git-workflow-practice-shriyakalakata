Link to an [article I found interesting](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/25/business/ai-image-generators-openai-microsoft-midjourney-copyright.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)

### My thoughts
The ability of an AI image generator to produce images strikingly similar to copyrighted content from iconic movies such as "The Joker" and "Iron Man" introduces a compelling intersection of technology and intellectual property. Artificial intelligence and its ability to replicate intricate visual details raises questions about the fine line between inspiration and infringement. It prompts a critical examination of the AI's training data and the nuances of creativity, as the generator seems to channel the essence of copyrighted characters without explicit programming for such specificity.

Moreover, this scenario amplifies the ongoing discourse surrounding the legal and ethical implications of AI-generated content. As these algorithms autonomously synthesize images resembling copyrighted material, it challenges conventional notions of authorship and artistic expression. The convergence of AI capabilities and copyrighted imagery beckons a reevaluation of intellectual property laws in the digital age, urging us to navigate the delicate balance between fostering innovation and safeguarding the rights of original creators.

Glenda: What I don't understand is what the major problem to this is? Yes near copyrighted images are generated, but couldn't someone draw up the same image in a simailar way? The only difference is that it is easier to do so. It is also interesting to note how much ai image generators have advanced just over the past year.
